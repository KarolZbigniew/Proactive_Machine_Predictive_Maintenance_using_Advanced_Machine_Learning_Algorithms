The primary goal of the project is to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of implementing tools such as Pipeline transformers and Grid Search for training machine learning models. By applying these tools, the project aims to optimize the model creation process, enabling simultaneous management of various data processing stages and the search for optimal model hyperparameters. As a result, the project can provide valuable insights into effective practices in the field of predicting machine failures using advanced machine learning techniques.
